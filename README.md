# Wordle Guessing Bot Project

## Project Overview

This Python project automates the process of guessing words using the Wordle FastAPI from Votee AI. The program interacts with the API to submit guesses and refine them based on the feedback received, aiming to efficiently solve Wordle puzzles.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank the following resources and individuals for their invaluable assistance and tutorials, which greatly contributed to the completion of this project:

- **baraltech**: Offered essential insights into Python programming and how to approach the Wordle game logic. Watch the tutorial on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/mJ2hPj3kURg?si=9RMtio2wfvKnf_O-).
- **Caleb Curry**: Offered essential insights into REST API and how to access the API. Check out his guide [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbLc5a9jdXo).
- **GPT-4 Turbo on Poe**: For real-time coding assistance and troubleshooting. Access the session [here](https://poe.com/s/wDSdrXoftsin1bZ06Wz7).

## Features

- **Automatic Guessing**: The bot makes guesses based on previous feedback, refining its strategy with each attempt.
- **API Integration**: Utilizes the Wordle FastAPI from Votee AI to receive real-time feedback on each guess.

## How It Works

The bot starts with a default guess and uses the feedback from the API to adjust its subsequent guesses. It continues this process until it successfully guesses the word or exhausts the allowed attempts.
